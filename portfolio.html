      <h1>Portfolio</h1>
        <p>These are all projects I made during my freshman year while using CodeHS. They were part of what I learned in my Computer Science 1 class, and each one helped me get more comfortable with coding and building things on my own.</p>

        <h1>Career Website</h1>
          <p>I created this website to highlight my interest in computer science and my career aspiration to become a software developer. I chose to focus on a Computer Science degree because it provides essential knowledge in programming and problem-solving skills needed for the role. The website also outlines the common steps to become a software developer, such as completing education, gaining practical experience through projects or internships, and continually updating technical skills. Building this site was a great way for me to explore the career path and improve my web development skills.</p>

        <h1>Gradebook</h1>
          <p>I worked on this gradebook project as a partner assignment. On the gradebook page, you can enter the number of students and how many grades you want to include, and it will generate a custom gradebook setup. In the attendance page, you can type in the students' assignment grades, and the program automatically calculates each studentâ€™s average. There's also an attendance page where you can update each student's status as present, late, or absent. This project helped me practice working with forms, data input, and logic in code, while also building something useful for organizing student information.</p>
