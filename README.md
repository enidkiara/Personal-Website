# Personal-Website
Hi! I’m Kiara, and this is my personal website. It has a Home page, where I introduce myself and share a little about who I am, and a Portfolio page, where I showcase my coding projects, creative work, and other achievements. The website is designed so visitors can easily see my skills, interests, and the projects I’m most proud of.
